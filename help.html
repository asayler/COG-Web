    COG is still in beta. As such, you may encounter occasional

    way, feel free to email any issues you encounter or questions you
    have to Andy at
    <a href="mailto:andy.sayler@colorado.edu">andy.sayler@colorado.edu</a>.
    Please include a description of you issue and the browser/OS you are

  <p>
    If Andy gets hit by a bus, then please email

    instead. In addition, should you feel so inclined, you are
    welcome to file bug reports or feature requests directly on
    <a href="https://github.com/asayler/COG-Web"
       target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You know, if that's your
    thing... Bug reports sent via carrier pigeon should conform to
    <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt"
       target="_blank">RFC 1149</a>.
    All feature requests will be considered relative to their merit
